# HASSLE-SOLUTION SECTION
hassle_intro: 'We help you help yourself by taking care of your customers.'
hassle_solution:
  -
    hassle: 'Your carriers find themselves waiting around at the loading dock when they arrive.'
    solution: 'Your staff will <a href="/products#eld">know when to be ready</a> so carrier can complete their job and move on.'
  -
    hassle: 'Your carriers don’t always feel like their privacy is respected.'
    solution: 'Authorization for tracking happens on an individual customer level and on a one-time authorization policy, so the carrier decides when and with whom they want to share their information.'
  -
    hassle: 'Trucks are assigned for tracking too early.'
    solution: 'Your carriers can opt to hide their location until the truck reaches the pickup geo-fence.'
  -
    hassle: 'Carriers can incur costs of up to a few thousand dollars to set up EDI tracking, and it can take at least 3-4 months to set up'
    solution: 'Our tracking is <a href="/products#mobile">completely free for carriers</a> with no ongoing cost, and we can activate our service in just a few days.'
  -
    hassle: 'You don’t have control over sharing the location of specific trucks in your fleet.'
    solution: 'We only <a href="/products#eld">track specific trucks</a> with specific tractor numbers, not full-on fleets.'
  - 
    hassle: 'You find yourself tracking the incorrect truck halfway across the country.'
    solution: 'The tractor location has to make sense with the load parameters or tracking automatically stops. Our software also considers <a href="/products#eld">domiciles, relays, and truck changes</a>.'
  -
    hassle: 'Your carriers don’t know when they’re being watched.'
    solution: 'Carriers can <a href="/products#mobile">check which trucks are being tracked and by whom</a>, plus they can sign up for <a href="/products#mobile">email notifications</a> from start to finish for their specific truck tracking.'
