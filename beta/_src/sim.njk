            <p>Robots have penetrated into our society at an astonishing rate over the past  fifteen years. What started as machines performing repetitive tasks in industrial settings evolved into single-purpose machines for households tasks, and has more recently turned into dozens of different variations of robots that aim to closely integrate into our daily lives.</p>

            <p>We thought it was important to re-examine our interactions with these technologies and understand how we can design more natural and intuitive interactions.</p>
