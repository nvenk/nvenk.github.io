            <p>Many of us have grown up watching movies and cartoons with robot companions. Robots like R2-D2, Rosie, and Wall-E all have such incredible personality that we start <em>forming bonds</em> with these characters. However, in real life, robots have typically been industrial machines, built to perform very specific tasks, and handled by trained operators.</p>

            <p>All that is about to change. Over the last few years, we have seen a rise in popularity of <em>intelligent systems</em>. Software like Alexa and Google Assistant serve as general assistants, able to handle a <em>variety of everyday tasks</em>. As a logical progression, we saw a whole bunch of <em>robot helpers</em> being announced at CES 2017, and this got us thinking about these software assistants and how they can be integrated into our lives more easily.</p>

            <p>We thought it was important to <em>re-examine our interactions</em> with these technologies and understand how we can design more <em>natural and intuitive</em> interactions.</p>
