            <p>Growing up watching movies and cartoons, our idea of the term <em>robot</em> is very different from the robots that exist in the world today. The last half-century has introduced robots that are purpose-built. They are built to do one thing and do it really well. They're hard to operate, and are usually in an industrial setting operated by trained professionals.</p>

            <p>But we have seen visions of a different kind of robot. Robots like R2-D2, BayMax, and Wall-E - ones that have such incredible personality, and are so full of "life" that we start forming emotional bonds with them.</p>

            <p>As this vision of a <em>robot companion</em> comes closer to becoming a reality with companion robots like Jibo and Kuri, we thought it was important to <em>re-examine our interactions</em> with these robots and understand how we can design more <em>natural and intuitive</em> interaction paradigms.</p>

            <p>This project was our <em>Capstone at the HCDE Masters program</em> at the University of Washington. I was the <em>primary designer</em> on the team, working alongside two engineers and a project manager/designer.</p>
