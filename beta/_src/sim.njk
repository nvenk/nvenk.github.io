            <p>Growing up watching movies and cartoons, our idea of the term <em>robot</em> is very different from the robots that exist in the world today. The last half-century has introduced robots that are purpose-built. They are built to do one thing and do it really well. They're hard to operate, and are usually in an industrial setting operated by trained professionals.</p>

            <p>But we have seen visions of a different kind of robot. Robots like R2-D2, BayMax, and Wall-E - ones that have such incredible personality, and are so full of "life" that we start forming emotional bonds with them.</p>

            <p>As this vision of a <em>robot companion</em> comes closer to becoming a reality with companion robots like Jibo and Kuri, we thought it was important to <em>re-examine our interactions</em> with these robots and understand how we can design more <em>natural and intuitive</em> interaction paradigms.</p>

            <p>This project was our <em>Capstone at the HCDE Masters program</em> at the University of Washington. I was the <em>primary designer</em> on the team, working alongside two engineers and a project manager/designer.</p>

            <p>The idea of social robots isn't new. We were inspired by 'Project EMAR', a robotics project run by professors at the University of Washington to create a robot that can collect survey data <em>in context</em> from users. We were inspired by the idea of robots integrating into society, but the <em>biggest obstacle</em> that we noticed was that people interacting with EMAR had <em>expectations</em> of how to interact with it before their first interaction - likely because of its humanoid form.</p>

            <p>Other studies in Human-Robot interaction also suggest that accounting for <em>simple social aspects</em> in the design of robots improves our interactions with them. Robots that are capable of displaying social cues and nonverbal behaviors during collaborative tasks attribute to improved task performance, higher recall accuracy, error prevention and faster task-completion times.</p>

            <p>It was clear from our research that people had social expectations from interactive robots. If robots are to become a part of our everyday lives, it isn't enough if they help us physically. They need to provide <em>mental and emotional assistance</em> as well. This thought helped us derive our research question...</p>

            <p>We had done the groundwork, were super inspired, and had our research question and hypotheses - but we needed a way to test them. We build <em>SIM</em> - our prototype of a socially intelligent robot. SIM can engage in <em>affective interchanges</em> with people by <em>understanding</em> and <em>expressing</em> emotions. It's behavior is governed by what we call the Social Interaction Model.</p>

            <p>Built on theories of human emotion from psychology, behavioral sciences and human-robot interaction, the SIM table is essentially a <em>map</em> of situations, emotions, behaviors, and functions. The SIM table defines how SIM would <em>react to an emotional stimulus</em> in a given situation, and how that emotional response would <em>affect the dynamics</em> of that interaction.</p>

            <p>Knowing what emotions SIM needed to express before-hand made it much easier to work out the design and technical details.</p>

            <p>For the body, we used three motors - two for the head and one for the body. This gave us enough <em>flexibility</em> to design expressive movements. We mounted an android powered phone for SIM's head, giving us <em>a blank canvas</em> to design SIM's face on.</p>

            <p>For the facial design, we wanted to keep things simple and as universally understandable as possible. I designed SIM's face to be <em>minimal, but super versatile</em>, so SIM's expressions are <em>exaggerated</em> and easily understandable.</p>
