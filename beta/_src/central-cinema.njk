            <p>We've all seen some incredible movies that were released years ago and wished we could watch them again on the big screen. This is exactly what Central Cinema is all about. Located in Seattle's Central District, Central Cinema was a neighborhood "beer-theatre". As you entered the venue, you are hit with a sense of nostaliga - from the decor and the posters of cult classics on the walls, to the movies that are showing on the big screen!</p>

            <p>While the service they offer is enticing, their website doesn't quite reflect the Central Cinema experience. We took this as an opportunity and set out to design their new website.</p>

                <p>Before jumping in, we wanted to understand the business, identify the business goals and define our scope.</p>

                <p>We met Kevin, the owner to talk about why he runs the business, what his motivations are, and what he would like to get out of this redesign.</p>

                <p>We quickly identified his primary pain point - he couldn't predict how many people were going to show up for a particular show. Most customers bought their tickets at the gate.</p>

            <p>Speaking to Kevin gave us some great insights and ideas to improve his business, but we still didn't know what his customers wanted. Why weren't they booking tickets online? Do they even use the website? What could we do to encourage people to use the website?</p>
            <p>Our hunt for answers has us following many methods</p>
            <ul class="content--list">
                <li><em>Interviews and Surveys</em> with employees and customers helped us understand business operations and customer patterns. We were able to understand what customers types of customers frequented the establishment, what tasks they used the website for, and where the current website failed them.</li>
                <li>A <em>Competitive Analysis</em> helped us understand what other successful businesses were doing right. It helped us understand what users needed in a theatre website.</li>
                <li>A <em>Heuristic Evaluation</em> of the current Central Cinema website helped us understand all that was wrong with it. We used this to understand what parts of the website needed work and how to proceed with the design process.</li>
