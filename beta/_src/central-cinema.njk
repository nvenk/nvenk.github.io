            <p>We've all seen some incredible movies that were released years ago and wished we could have watched them on the big screen. This is exactly what Central Cinema is all about. Located in Seattle's Central District, Central Cinema was a neighborhood "beer-theatre". As you entered the venue, you are hit with a sense of nostaliga - from the decor and the posters of cult classics on the walls, to the movies that were playing.</p>

            <p>We set out to revamp their website and create an experience that was more in line with   the experience they offered.</p>
