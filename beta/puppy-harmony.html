          <p>We've all heard the saying:
            <em>Dogs are man's best friend</em>. People who have had pets will understand how true this statement is. We love spending time with our dogs, but sometimes our commitments don't give us much time to give them the exercise and attention they need.</p>
          <p>Most dogs need a ton of
            <em>physical exercise</em>, and the
            <em>company of other dogs</em> helps them grow up to be social and well rounded animals. Enter - PuppyHarmony. With PuppyHarmony, you can easily find and connect with other like-minded dog owners in your area to bring your dogs together to exercise,
            socialize and have fun!</p>

        <div class="fg--cell content--text center">
          <p>Right from the beginning, we focused on understanding the business aspect of design. We wanted to use this project to learn how we can
            <em>take an idea and monetize it</em>. How do we come up with a business plan? How do we take those business goals and balance them with the user's needs? What does this mean for the design?</p>
          <p>To figure all this out, we followed a number of steps:</p>
          <ul class="content--list">
            <li>We created a
              <em>Business Model Canvas</em> to clearly define our product - Our value proposition, who our key partners would be, what resources we would need, how much it would cost to build and run this business, and how we would make money out of it.</li>
            <li>We then brainstormed a
              <em>feature list</em> - What features did we need to offer to actually provide the value we intend to?</li>
            <li>From that feature list, we eliminated the ones that were not necessary for the
              <em>Minimum Viable Product</em>, and created a business plan.</li>
            <li>To find out more about our users, and our business space, we conducted
              <em>interviews</em> with dog owners and potential users, and we did an extensive
              <em>competitive analysis</em> to see who we would be competing against.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At this point, we had a business model, we learned that there was very little competition and
            <em>a lot of opportunity</em> in this space, and our potential users were excited about this idea - so were we!</p>

          <p>At this point, PuppyHarmony was essentially a matchmaking service for pets. Our research with customers and competitors showed us that the
            <em>biggest pain point</em> was not finding other dog owners. Every dog is different and the difficulty was in finding a friend for your pet that was
            <em>compatible</em> - in terms of factors like temperament, size and age.</p>
          <p>With the first round of wireframes, our goal was to
            <em>explore the parameters</em> that would form the backbone of the matchmaking process. Essentially we wanted to know what information we needed from owners to provide an effective service. More importantly, we wanted to know if our users
            <em>understood</em> the questions and terms that we used.</p>
          <p>The wireframes that I created were a very useful to start thinking about screen flows and user journeys - but this wasn't a format that we could show users and get feedback with. I took this opportunity to create a prototype with
            <em>Indigo Studio</em>.</p>
