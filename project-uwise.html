				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>As a part of our class project, we are looking to explore the problems that international students face when they move to the United States. The change in climate, food, culture, laws and overall lifestyle add to the challenges of everyday school
					life for these students. Our goal is to find a solution to make this transition easier for international students who are new to the country, and help them settle down more comfortably and quickly.</p>
				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>We worked on this project over ten weeks, but worked through the entire user centered design process as best we could.</p>
				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>We did some research among International students at the University of Washington, Bellevue College and Seattle Central College, targeting International students who had just moved to the United States, and ones who had moved to the United States
					a few years ago.</p>
				<p>We conducted a survey among students from 11 countries, and interviewed students from 4 countries.</p>
				<p><img alt="Survey Word Cloud" src="assets/img/projects/uwise/research-1.png" /></p>
				<p>Our research findings allowed us to narrow down our focus on the top problems that our target users faced. We found that finding good and affordable housing, and roommates was the biggest problem that they faced. A lot of our participants also expressed
					that they would have liked to have a point of contact before they arrived, so they could get some information from them.</p>
				<p>We now had a general idea of what our solution should be.</p>
				<p>We also identified and understood the workings of a student body that was providing a similar solution, by helping new students who are moving to the county. They provided temporary housing, airport pick-up, information and mentorship for everyday
					life activities. &lt;/div&gt;</p>
				<h2>Personas</h2>
				<p>From our research findings, we went on to create personas. We identified that there were two distinct roles that would need to be filled. We have students who are outside the country who need help, and students who are already in the country who could
					provide help and information.</p>
				<p><img alt="Personas" src="assets/img/projects/uwise/personas-1.jpg" /></p>
				<p>We designed three distinct personas who met these criteria.</p>
				<h2>Design Requirements</h2>
				<p>At this point in the process, ideas had started forming in our heads as to what the ideal solution should be. We sat down and put our heads together, and came up with a list of design requirements, to make sure that we were all on the same page.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The solution should be internationally available and easily accessible.</li>
					<li>It should connect new students to each other.</li>
					<li>It should connect new students with existing students who had moved to the United States before them.</li>
					<li>It should be a secure platform, with some form of verification, to make sure that the information posted is legitimate.</li>
				</ol>
				<h2>Brainstorming &amp; Sketching</h2>
				<p>We conducted a brainstorming session with all the designers and the manager, to get all our ideas and thoughts out in the open. We discussed various ideas, and weeded out some of the ideas that did not fit the design requirements. This also allowed
					us all to bounce ideas off each other and evolve them into more concise once. We picked the best of the ideas and created low fidelity wireframes to refine them even more.</p>
				<h2>Wireframes</h2>
				<p><img alt="Wireframes" src="assets/img/projects/uwise/wireframes-1.jpg" /></p>
				<h2>Prototyping &amp; User Testing</h2>
				<p>We converted our wireframes into paper prototypes. We created some tasks that students would use the app for, and tested the usability and clarity of the interface.</p>
				<p>We are in the process of conducting more user tests before iterating our design and freezing our final design solution.</p>
				<h2>Visual Design</h2>
				<p>Once we test the usability of the prototype, we plan to make hi-fidelity mockups to test the clarity and usability of the final interface again. We will update this section in the near future, once we have completed this step.</p>
				<h2>What I&#39;ve Learnt</h2>
				<p>This project gave me a really great understanding of the user centered design process. I learnt a great deal from it, the major takeaways being:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Research is incredibly important! Take your time and do it well.</li>
					<li>Meet the team regularly to make sure everyone is on the same page.</li>
					<li>Dedicate enough time to user research and testing. They will save you a lot more time later in the process.</li>
				</ol>
