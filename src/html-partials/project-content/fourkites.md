## The Problem

As a part of a class project, we sought to explore the problems that international students face when they move to the United States. The change in climate, food, culture, laws and overall lifestyle add to the challenges of everyday school life for these students. Our goal is to find a solution to make this transition easier for international students who are new to the country, and help them settle down more comfortably and quickly.

## Process

We worked on this project over ten weeks. We worked through the entire user-centered design process, from User Research to Hi-Fidelity prototypes.

## Research

Our research group consisted of international students at the University of Washington, Bellevue College and Seattle Central College, who had just moved to the United States. We also interviewed a few students who had moved to the United States a few years ago.

We conducted a survey among students from 11 countries, and interviewed students from 4 countries.

Our research findings allowed us to narrow down our focus on the top problems that our target users faced. The research data showed us that finding good and affordable housing, and roommates was the biggest problem that they faced. A lot of our participants also expressed that they would have liked to have a point of contact before they arrived, so they would have access to information that would help them plan their trips better.

We now had a general idea of what our solution should be.

We also identified and understood the workings of a student body that was providing a similar solution by helping new students who are moving to the country. They provided temporary housing, airport pick-ups, information and mentorship for everyday life activities.

## Personas

Using the data gathered from our research, we went on to create personas. We identified that there were two distinct roles that would need to be filled. We have students who are outside the country who need help, and students who are already in the country who could provide help and information.

We designed two primary personas, Satish and Amira, who were students starting their programs this year, and one secondary persona, Hari, who has been at the University of Washington for a year now, and is willing to help new students transition.

## Design Requirements

At this point, ideas had started forming in our heads as to what the ideal solution should be. We sat down and put our heads together to come up with a list of design requirements, to make sure that we were all on the same page.

1. The solution should be internationally available and easily accessible.
2. It should connect new students to each other.
3. It should connect new students with existing students who had moved to the United States before them.
4. It should be a secure platform, with some form of verification, to make sure that the information posted is legitimate.

## Brainstorming & Sketching

Keeping our design requirements at the back of our heads, the team got together and brainstormed ideas. The sky was the limit here, and we encouraged each other to come up with some really wild ideas. Doing so allowed us all to bounce ideas off each other and evolve them into more concise once. It let us open our minds to some really crazy ideas, and we came up with a lot of cool but impossible ones, but also got some really great and feasible plans for the solution we wanted to design.

We picked the best of the ideas and created low fidelity wireframes to refine adn test them.

## Wireframes

## Prototyping & User Testing

We converted our wireframes into paper prototypes and created a task flow that students would use the app for. We tested for usability issues and clarity of the interface.

We conducted usability tests with four users and got some very valuable feedback about the information architecture, the interface flow, and we were also able to deduce some information about what sort of icons worked for an international audience, and what didn't.

We iterated the prototype and are ready to test again and move on to the next phase.

## Next Steps - Visual Design

Once we test the revised prototype to make sure that the interface is easy to understand and navigate, we will make high fidelity prototypes to test the visual style and appeal of the app. 

I'll update this section with our hi-fidelity test results and screenshots soon.

## What I've Learnt

This project has been amazing to work on, and has helped me understand how to design with the user in mind. I learnt a great deal from it, but to list my top takeaways from working on this project:

1. Research is the key! It is important to take your time and do it right.
2. Keep the users close to the design process, and keep testing with them every step of the way.
3. When designing for an international audience, it is important to talk to users from different demographics and make sure the solution would work just as well for all of them.
4. Listen closely to what everybody has to say. Sometimes, ideas come out of the most unexpected places.
