## Introduction

PuppyHarmony is an app that enables dog owners to easily find and connect with other dog owners to bring their pets together for play-dates, exercise and socialization. 

This was a class project as part of the 'Design in an Organization' program at the University of Washington. This course was great in preparing us to influence design in a business world, and how to design while keeping the business goals in mind. We worked with a client team, who oversaw the development of the business and product.

## My Role

I was the interaction / visual designer in our team of four. My responsibilities included visual design, wireframing and prototyping, but I was involved in the entire project cycle, from brainstorming and ideating features and developing a business plan, and creating documentation.

## Design Process

This class encouraged us to take on a very different approach to designing a product. Viewing things from a business point of view, we began by brainstorming features for the product. By writing a press release before building the product, we put the team's vision for the product on paper. 

We then worked on building a functional business model and an interactive prototype.

## Research

Since we were developing a completely new product, we needed to research into multiple aspects. To find out if it would work as a business, we needed to find out who the comptition was and understand their weeknesses and strenghts. We needed to understand where puppyHarmony would generate revenue from. From a design angle, we needed to understand who the users would be, what their needs were and how their pets were getting exercise and playtime.

We conducted heavy competitive analysie to get a sense of what user needs were not being met. Analysis revealed that there weren't many products that had the same value proposition as puppyHarmony. We also interviewed several dog owners to understand what they were currently doing and how puppyHarmony could benifit them.

Once we were sure that it would be useful and it would make for a profitable business, we began sorting which features needed to be in version 1, and drew up some wireframes.

## Wireframes

The most challenging aspect of this phase was deciding which features should make it to version 1, and which ones should be waitlisted for version 2. Ultimately, we looked back at the business goals and chose only those features that were absolutely essential to fill the user's needs and to accomplish the goals of puppyHarmony.

## Interactive Prototype

We built an interactive prototype to show the clients how puppyHarmony would work, and to give them an understanding of how users would interact with the app.

## Results

The clients were happy with the overall work. The research findings showed that puppyHarmony would be a viable and profitable business. The wireframes did a good job in showing what features would be essential for the first version of the product. They immediately understood how the user would use the app, and what needs it would fulfill. They were very happy with the way the prototype showed how the user would interact with puppyHarmony.

## Takeaways

1. Always keep the goals of the business in mind, every step of the process.
2. It is equally important to research the business prospects of a product, and understand how the business works and where the revenue comes from.
3. Learn to undersand what features are absolutely essential for your product, and build the Minimum Viable Product to test the waters first.
