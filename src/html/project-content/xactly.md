## Introduction

In the summer of 2016, 9 months after I started studying HCDE at the University of Washington, I got the opportunity to put my skills to the test at Xactly Corporation in San Jose. Xactly is a enterprise SaaS company, providing industry leading sales compensation management for companies of all sizes. I joined as an intern into the Product Management team as a UX designer intern, and the first UX designer in the company. Being the only designer on the team for over half my internship, I had to be quick on my feet, take on multiple simultaneous projects, communicate and justify design decisions to various teams including Product Management and Engineering.

*All of the projects I mention below are on-going and I'm actively working on most of them. While I cannot go into details and specifics, I can talk about the challenges I faced, the processes followed and the lessons learnt.*
