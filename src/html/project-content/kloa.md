## Introduction

Mobile typing hasn't changed much since the dawn of the smartphone. QWERTY was adopted as the standard English keyboard layout because people were already used to it. It is definitely not the simplest way to type on the small screen, and Kloa is trying to change that. 

Kloa is a new input method for mobile devices. Using bigger keys and some interesting math, it aims to help people spend less time typing on small screens. While this seems awesome in theory, everything about Kloa is completely new and different.

Our team took up the challenge of running usability studies on Kloa, to see if people would be able to learn to use it easily, and learn what challenges they would have to overcome to adopt it as their default input method.

## Interaction Map

To fully understand how Kloa works, we used it ourselves for a few weeks and created an interaction map. This helped us map out all the functions of the product in one view. We also planned on using the interaction map as a tool to teach our test participants how to use Kloa. This would provide a graphical way to explain how the keyboard and its gestures work and could also serve as a reference sheet for users to look at until they get accustomed to the interactions.

## Roles

![Kloa Team Members](assets/img/projects/kloa/team-1.jpg)

This project was part of the 'Usability Studies' class at the University of Washington.

Our Team of three included: 

> __Hong Zhu__ - The Scheduling and Communications Expert

> __Nikhil Venkatesh__ - The Technical Guy and Visual Designer

> __Sahil Anand__ - The Moderator and Client Relationships

Each of us got a chance to moderate at least two sessions, with Sahil moderating the remaining tests. We ensured that all members of the team were present for each test, and both members who were not moderating were taking notes to be sure that we covered everything.
