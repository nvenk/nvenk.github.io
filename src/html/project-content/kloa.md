## Introduction

KLOA is a startup that is developing a new gesture-based input method for mobile devices. The keyboard focuses on making text inputs faster and more accurate by making the keys larger and easier to hit. Pairing the larger touch targets with their error correction algorithm ensures that users always type what they want to, and spend less time in correcting typos.

This input method, while theoratically more efficient than QWERTY, was completely new. For Kloa to be successful, users have to be able to learn and adopt it without any difficulty. Our team was tasked with conducting usability testing to assess Kloa's adoption rate and learnability, and suggest changes to help users get used to Kloa faster.

This project was part of the 'Usability Studies' class at the University of Washington.

## Interaction Map

To fully understand Kloa and how it worked, we used Kloa ourselves for a few weeks and created an interaction map. This helped us map out all the functions of the product in one view. We also planned on using the interaction map as an onboarding tool for our test participants. This would provide a graphical way to explain how the keybaord and it's gestures work, and could also serve as a reference sheet for users to look at, until they got accustomed to the interactions.
