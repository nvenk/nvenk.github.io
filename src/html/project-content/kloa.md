## Introduction

Mobile typing hasn't changed much since the dawn of the smartphone. QWERTY was adopted as the standard English keyboard layout because people were already used to it. It is definitely not the simplest way to type on the small screen, and Kloa is trying to change that. 

Kloa is a new input method for mobile devices. Using bigger keys and some interesting math, it aims to help people spend less time typing on small screens. While this seems awesome in theory, everything about Kloa is completely new and different.

Our team took up the challenge of running usability studies on Kloa, to see if people would be able to learn to use it easily, and learn what challenges they would have to overcome to adopt it as their default input method.

## Interaction Map

Before testing the product with users, we had to understand everything about it ourselves. We spent a week using Kloa, and mapped out the interactions in a way that could be easily understood. 

Since there was no on-boarding process for Kloa, we decided to use the interaction map as a teaching tool for out participants. The team sat together to decide what information should be on the map, and how it should be laid out. I then created it with the visual style that I've been developing for this project.

<!-- ## Who are the Users?

We wanted to recruit participants who are more likely to try new technologies and apps, and are willing to stick to an unfinished product for the duration of the test. We chose to test an equal number of male and female participants.

## Roles

![Kloa Team Members](assets/img/projects/kloa/team-1.jpg)

This project was part of the 'Usability Studies' class at the University of Washington.

Our Team of three included: 

> __Hong Zhu__ - The Scheduling and Communications Expert

> __Nikhil Venkatesh__ - The Technical Guy and Visual Designer

> __Sahil Anand__ - The Moderator and Client Relationships

The overall test design and participant recrutitng was a combined effort. Each of us got a chance to moderate at least two sessions, with Sahil moderating the remaining tests. We ensured that all members of the team were present for each test, and both members who were not moderating were taking notes to be sure that we covered everything. 

My responsibilities included handling the technical equipment for the tests, and recording the quantitative data that we collected.
