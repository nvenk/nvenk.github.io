## Introduction

Mobile typing hasn't changed much since the dawn of the smartphone. QWERTY was adopted as the standard english keyboard layout because people were already used to it. It is definitely not the simplest way to type on the small screen, and Kloa is trying to change that. 

Kloa is a new input method for mobile devices. Using bigger keys and some interesting math, it aims to help people spend less time typing on small screens. While this seems awesome in theory, everything about Kloa is completely new and different.

Our team took up the challenge of running usability studies on Kloa, to see if people would be able to learn to use it easily, and learn what challenges they would have to overcome to adopt it as their default input method.

This project was part of the 'Usability Studies' class at the University of Washington.

## Interaction Map

To fully understand how Kloa works, we used it ourselves for a few weeks and created an interaction map. This helped us map out all the functions of the product in one view. We also planned on using the interaction map as a tool to teach our test participants how to use Kloa. This would provide a graphical way to explain how the keybaord and its gestures work and could also serve as a reference sheet for users to look at until they got accustomed to the interactions.
