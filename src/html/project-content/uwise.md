## The Problem

We sought to explore the problems that international students face when they move to the United States. The change in climate, food, culture, laws and overall lifestyle add to the challenges of everyday school life for these students. Our goal is to find a solution to make this transition easier for international students who are new to the country and help them settle down more comfortably and quickly.

## Process

This project was a part of the 'User Centered Design' class at the University of Washington. The theme was 'UX for good'. The project spanned over 10 weeks. We worked through the entire user-centered design process from user research to hi-fidelity prototypes.

## Research

Our research group consisted of international students from the University of Washington, Bellevue College and Seattle Central College, who recently relocated to the United States. We also interviewed several students who have been in America for a few years.

We surveyed students from over 11 countries and interviewed students from 4 countries.

Our research findings allowed us to narrow our focus to top problems faced by our target users. The research data showed us that finding good, affordable housing and like-minded roommates are the biggest problems they face. A lot of our participants also expressed that they would like to have had a point of contact before they arrived so that they could have access to information to help them plan their trips better.

We also identified and understood the workings of a student body that was providing a similar solution by helping new students moving to Seattle. They provided temporary housing, airport pick-ups, information and mentorship with regards to everyday activities.

## Personas

Using the data gathered from our research, we went on to create personas. We identified two distinct roles - students who are outside the country looking for help and students already in the country, who are in a position to offer help and information.

We designed two primary personas, Satish and Amira, who were students starting their programs this year and a secondary persona, Hari, who has been at the University of Washington for a year now, and is willing to help new students transition.

## Design Requirements

We put our heads together to come up with a list of design requirements to make sure that we were all on the same page.

1. The solution should be internationally available and easily accessible.
2. It should connect new students to each other.
3. It should connect new students with existing students already studying in the United States.
4. It should be a secure platform with some form of verification to make sure that the information posted is legitimate.

## Brainstorming & Sketching

Keeping the design requirements in mind, we got together and brainstormed ideas. The sky was the limit here, and we encouraged each other to come up with as many ambitious ideas as possible.

We picked the best of the instances and created low fidelity wireframes to refine and test them.

## Prototyping & User Testing

We converted our wireframes into paper prototypes and created a task flow. We tested for usability issues and clarity of the interface.

We conducted usability tests with four users and got some very valuable feedback about the information architecture and the interface flow. We were also able to deduce what sort of icons worked for an international audience and what didn't.

After a few iterations and rounds of feedback, we came up with a hi-fidelity mockup.

## Visual Design

With our high fidelity mockup, we wanted to get a sense of what exactly the android app would look like. A few things we focused on while creating this were:

1. Following the material design guidelines so the applications would have a native feel on android.
2. Using the University of Washington colors and branding to give users a sense of familiarity with the app.
3. Using the University of Washington NetID sign-in to ensure that all users were registered students with the university.
4. Using internationally understandable icons and labels.

## Takeaways

This project has been amazing to work on, and has helped me understand how to design with the user in mind. I learnt a great deal from it, but to list my top takeaways from working on this project:

1. Research is the key! It is important to take your time and do it right.
2. Keep the users close to the design process, and keep testing with them every step of the way.
3. When designing for an international audience, it is important to talk to users from different demographics and make sure the solution would work just as well for all of them.
4. Listen closely to what everybody has to say. Sometimes, ideas come out of the most unexpected places.
