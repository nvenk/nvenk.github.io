## Introduction

We were a team of design students who set out to redesign the website for a Seattle neighborhood theatre called Central Cinema. Our focus was to recreate the websiteâ€™s information architecture, ticket booking experience and visual design using a user-centered approach.

## My Role

I was the primary designer on the team, and dealt with:

1. Creating paper prototypes, consolidating ideas generated by the team to create a mid-fidelity interactive prototype.
2. Working with the team to assimilate feedback from usability sessions and make design recommendations for the second iteration.
3. Defining the visual and emotional design of the final website.
4. Incorporating the feedback and visual style to create a high fidelity prototype with framerJS.
5. Recruiting participants for a card sorting exercise, and synthesizing results to generate an improved information architecture.
6. Assisting in the research phase by conducting contextual inquiries and generating recommendations for design based on research findings.

*That being said, every phase of this project was a team effort, and everyone played a role in shaping it's outcome. The project would not be what it is without the valuable work and inputs of my team.*

## What is Central Cinema?

Central Cinema is not a regular cinema theatre. It is an off-beat retro theatre that plays cult classics on the big screen while serving some great food and drinks during the movie. Our team loved the in-person experience, but saw that their online presence needed much work. This is the story of how we went from their current website...

Here's the story of how we got here...

## Objectives and Scoping

To kick off the redesign, we met with the owner of Central Cinema to determine business goals to give us direction. From that meeting, we scoped the effort to:

1. Simplify the ticket purchase flow
2. Improve content organization and information architecture
3. Make visible call-to-actions and provide a path for users
4. Create a visual language to match the in-person experience at Central Cinema.

## Research

We approached the research phase from various angles, each of us taking charge of a different method. Some of the primary research methods we used included:
1. Performing a __Heuristic Evaluations__ of the existing website.
2. __Interviewing__ current customers to get an idea of what their top tasks on the website were.
3. __Interviewing__ stakeholders(Central Cinema staff) to get an idea of business operations and customer feedback.
4. __Surveying__ Central Cinema customers and email newsletter subscribers about their online experience.
5. __Competitive Analysis__ of other similar venues with ticket booking experiences.

From our findings we synthesized two personas and a task matrix outlining their primary and secondary tasks.

## Ideation

> Finding common themes and deciding the direction of the website design.

Individually, we came up with sketches of what our ideal solution to the problem would be. We then met as a team to discuss various points like content strategy, interaction maps, and the pros and cons of each design.

We then conducted a card sort with 20 participants to determine a simplified information architecture and top-level navigation.

## Mid-Fidelity Prototype

After creating an improved sitemap from the card-sort data, I created a mid-fidelity prototype that we could use for usability tests.

## Usability Testing

We tested the prototype to assess the efficiency and usability of our design. The test results were a mixed bucket, and we got some really valuable positive and negative feedback.

> Our top takeaways from the usability testing sessions.

Some wins for us were:

1. The usability test using the prototype showed a much higher success rate when performing top tasks, as compared to the existing website.
2. The improved information architecture caused a lot less confusing and frustration when performing the top tasks.

## Iteration

A lot of usability testing and team meetings later, I had enough data to create a high fidelity prototype. I found Atomic a bit limiting when I created the mid-fidelity prototype, so I decided to move to __Framer Studio__ so I could explore better interactions and a bit of motion design.

I also took this opportunity to create a visual language for the website to try and reflect what central cinema represented. I redesigned the logo and overall color scheme to be more in line with the feeling of nostalgia that Central Cinema instills.

## Wins and Lessons

I loved working on this project. A fantastic team, and a subject that we were all passionate about. We had some incredible design conversations and I learnt a lot from this experience.

1. It was an interesting experience working with a local business. We got very different perspectives of the business when we spoke to the owner and the people who worked there. This prompted us to get a solid answer by actually visiting the venue and experiencing it for ourselves.
2. I had a lot of fun working on the visual design and branding. It was challenging to create a style that reflected central cinema's physical location, as well as their 'style'. Collaborating with others really helped to get an overall understanding of how that 'nostalgia' could be represented in terms of visual design.
3. It becomes incredibly hard to design for a business without knowing the business goals. As important as it is for the website to give it's users an incredible user experience, it's equally important to know the business priorities and talk to stakeholders often to see if we're aligned.
