Working with a team of graduate students, we set out to redesign the website for a local business in Seattle. We worked with Central Cinema to take a user-centered approach to redesigning their website's information architecture, ticket booking experience and visual design.

## As the team's designer, I...

1. Created paper prototypes and consolidated ideas generated by the team to create a mid-fidelity interactive prototype.
2. Worked with the team to assimilate feedback from usability sessions and make recommendations for the second iteration.
3. Defined the visual and emotional design of the final website.
4. Incorporated the feedback and visual style to create a high fidelity prototype with framerJS

__I also..__

1. Recruited participants for a card sorting exercise, and synthesized results to generate a better sitemap.
2. Assisted in the research phase, by conducting contextual inquiries and helping generate recommendations for design based on research findings.

## What is Central Cinema?

![The Team outside Central Cinema](assets/img/projects/centralCinema/cc_team.jpg)

Central Cinema is not a regular cinema theatre. It is an off-beat retro theatre that plays cult classics on the big screen while serving some great food and drinks during the movie. Our team loved the in-person experience, but saw that their online presence needed much work.

## Objectives and Scoping

To kick off the redesign, we met with the owner of Central Cinema to determine business goals to give us direction. From that meeting, we scoped the effort to:

1. Simplify the ticket purchase flow
2. Improve content organization and information architecture
3. Make visible call-to-actions and provide a path for users
4. Create a visual language to match the in-person experience at Central Cinema.

## Research

We approached the research phase from various angles, each of us taking charge of a different method.
1. Performed a __Heuristic Evaluations__ of the existing website.
2. __Interviewed__ current customers to get an idea of what their top tasks on the website were.
3. __Surveyed__ Central Cinema customers and email newsletter subscribers about their online experience.
4. Performed a __Competitive Analysis__ of other similar venues with a ticket booking experience.
5. Visited Central Cinema to perform a __Contextual Enquiry__ of the movie-going experience.
6. __Interviewed__ stakeholders(Central Cinema staff) to get an idea of business operations and customer feedback.

From our findings we synthesized two personas and a task matrix outlining their primary and secondary tasks.

## Ideation

Individually, we came up with sketches of what our ideal solution to the problem would be. We then met as a team and discussed various points, like content strategy, interaction maps and the pros and cons of each sketch.

We then conducted a card sort with 20 participants to determine a simplified information architecture and top-level navigation.

## Prototyping

After creating an improved sitemap from the card-sort data, I created a mid-fidelity prototype that we could use for usability tests.

## Usability Testing

We tested the prototype to assess the efficiency and usability of our design. The test results were a mixed bucket, and we got some really valuable positive and negative feedback.

Some wins for us were:

1. The usability test using the prototype showed a much higher success rate when performing top tasks, as compared to the existing website.
2. The improved information architecture caused a lot less confusing and frustration when performing the top tasks.

## Iteration

Based on the results of the test, I created a high-fidelity prototype in framer.js.

## Wins and Lessons

1. It was an interesting experience working with a local business. We got very different 'views' of the business when we spoke to the owner and the people who worked there. This prompted us to get a solid answer by actually visiting the venue and experiencing it for ourselves.
2. I had a lot of fun working on the visual design and branding. It was challenging to create a style that reflected central cinema's physical location, as well as their 'style'.
