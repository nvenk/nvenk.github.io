## The Product

Telegram is a cloud based messaging platform. I loved the concept of it when I first heard about it - Being able to chat from multiple devices with no lag, was on of it's unique features that pulled me to it. Over the years, telegram evolved into a solid, well adopted platform, both on mobile and desktops. The one thing that it was lacking, however was good interface design. 

## The Goal

I began redesigning the android version of telegram with a few goals in mind. I wanted to remove redundant UI elements, spice up the motion design to make more sense, and add a bit of physical world influence to the design. I wanted to create a unique experience that did not seem like standard material design.The end-goal was to create an experience with a focus on animation - An experience that is unique, delightful and functional.

## Inspiration

I wanted to stay true to the telegram branding and style, keeping the same blue and white scheme. For the style of movement, I chose to take inspiration from their logo, a paper airplane. I wanted to moving elements to feel light, like paper airplanes. I also wanted to keep things fast, so they don't slow down the experience. Adding a little playfulness would give the app a bit more personality and create a memorable experience. With these in mind, I went ahead and created my first set of mockups..
