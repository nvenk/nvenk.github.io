## The Product

Telegram is a cloud-based messaging platform. I loved the concept behind telegram when I first heard about it. Being able to chat from multiple devices with no lag was one of its unique features that intrigued me. Over the years, telegram has evolved into a solid, well adopted platform, both on mobile and desktops. The one thing that it is lacking, however is good interface design.

## The Goal

I began redesigning the android version of telegram with a few goals in mind. I wanted to remove redundant UI elements, spice up the motion design to make more sense, and add a bit of physical world influence to the design. I want to create a unique experience that went beyond the standard material design guidelines. I decided to create an experience with a strong focus on animation - An experience that is unique, delightful and functional.

## Inspiration

For the animation style, I chose to take inspiration from their logo, a paper airplane. I wanted the moving elements to feel light and fast, so they don't slow down the user's task. Adding a little playfulness would give the it more personality and create a memorable experience. With these in mind, I started creating my first set of mockups.
