## The Product

Telegram is a cloud-based messaging platform. I loved the concept behind telegram when I first heard about it. Being able to chat from multiple devices with no lag was one of its unique features that intrigued me. Over the years, telegram has evolved into a solid, well-adopted platform, both on mobile and desktops. The one thing that it is lacking however, is great interaction design.

## The Goal

I began redesigning the android version of Telegram with a few goals in mind. I wanted to remove redundant UI elements, spice up the motion design to make more sense and add a bit of physical world influence to the design. I want to create a unique experience that went beyond the standard material design guidelines. I decided to create an experience with a strong focus on animation - An experience that is unique, delightful and functional.

## Inspiration

For the animation style, I chose to take inspiration from their logo, a paper airplane. I wanted the moving elements to feel light and fast, so they don't slow down the user's task. Adding a little playfulness would give it more personality and create a memorable experience. With these in mind, I started creating my first set of mockups.

## Mockups

Since this was a personal project I decided to go with a fast and light approach. Minimal mockups allowed me to make changes on the fly. On the first pass, I focused on the splash screen, the layout of messages, the message tiles, and the fab button. 

## The Prototype

Following the mockups, I began creating a prototype on Framer.

## Reflections

Since I've only just started using Framer, this was my opportunity to experiment and discover what it could do. I also wanted to use SVGs in my prototype, so I used the snapSVG library to give me more control over shapes and elements. I tried experimenting a lot with animation curves to give the prototype a playful feel. 

The hardest part about making this prototype was the fact that this was the first full-blown project that I’ve worked on in Framer. I began the process with beginner-level knowledge of Javascript and no knowledge of CoffeeScript. Even still, I’m very happy with my efforts - especially the look and feel of the Splash screen and the animations on the message view screen.

## Going Forward

Far from being over, my work in this project so far has inspired me to extend the prototype to include interactions for the settings screen, individual messages view, and the create new message view. 

Learning from this iteration, however, I will plan the interactions much better, to give me a clear picture as to what I am working towards. I also have a much more solid understanding of CoffeeScript, Framer and how extensible and flexible it is. 

I'm looking forward to the hours of code to take this project forward.

Check back soon to see my progress on this project!
