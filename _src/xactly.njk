            <p>Over the summer of 2016, I interned at <em>Xactly Corporation</em> as a UX Designer. Being one of the two designers in the company, I was involved in a variety of products and exclusively handled design for two products that directly contributed to Xactly's user experience.</p>

            <p>Xactly is an enterprise SaaS company, and is a market leader in providing incentive compensation solutions for employee and sales performance management.</p>

            <p>While I was at Xactly, I worked with product management and engineering on a number of projects, acting as the <em>design lead</em> for two of them.</p>

            <p>Incent is Xactly's flagship product - a platform for companies to manage sales performance and incentive compensation. The Android application is geared towards the end users, enabling them to get an overview of their performance and quotas.</p>
