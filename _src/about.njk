    <p class="name">Hi, I'm <em>Nikhil</em></p>
    <p>I’m a <em>designer</em> and <em>animator</em>, based out of the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

    <p>Born in India in 1989, I’ve had a passion for animation as long as I can remember. That passion turned into a career animating dragons, mutant turtles and a cat wearing boots!</p>

    <p>Along the way, I was drawn by the amazing things that code can do and taught myself how to build websites. I started working as a freelancer, eventually leading me to discover the wonderful world of UX.</p>

    <p>I'm always trying to blur the lines these three sides of me - thinking about how my animation expertise can help me design better interactions and experiences, and figuring out how to actually build these experiences with code.</p>

    <p>I recently earned my <span class="sm">(second)</span> Masters degree, this time in <em>Human Centered Design & Engineering</em> from the University of Washington. I met some incredible people, designed awesome experiences and built a robot!</p>
