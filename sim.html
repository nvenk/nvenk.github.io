            <em>SIM</em> started out as our capstone project at the HCDE Masters program. Fueled by our mutual passion and fasciantion with robots, Sahil, John, Dorothy and I wanted to take a
            <em>human-centered approach</em> to designing and building social robots.</p>
          <p>The idea to build SIM stemed from our initial research and exploration. There are amazing strides being made in the field of social robotics in terms of technology, but we found that
            <em>interacting with these robots still felt unnatural and forced</em>. We also wanted to explore how we can take the Human Centered Approach that is so key to building digital experiences today, and apply those concepts to the world of social
            robots.</p>
          <p>Personally, this was a wonderful opportunity for me to bring together the three things that define me. I could apply my experience in
            <em>animation</em> and television to design SIM - how it would look, and how it would move. I was not only able to apply what I had learnt about
            <em>user-centered design</em>, but also explore how those concepts apply in a different context, in this case, robotics. Finally, I saw this as an awesome opportunity to learn more about building robots and
            <em> expand my knowledge about coding.</em>

          <p>The idea of social robots isn't new. We were inspired by 'Project EMAR', a robotics project run by professors at the University of Washington to create a robot that can collect survey data
            <em>in context</em> from users. The idea of robots integrating into society was fascinating, but the
            <em>biggest obstacle</em> we noticed was that people who were exposed to with EMAR had
            <em>preset expectations</em> of how to interact with it - likely because of its humanoid form.</p>
          <p>Other studies in Human-Robot interaction also suggest that accounting for
            <em>simple social aspects</em> in the design of robots improves our interactions with them. Robots that are capable of displaying social cues and nonverbal behaviors during collaborative tasks attribute to improved task performance, higher recall
            accuracy, error prevention and faster task-completion times.</p>
          <p>It was clear from our research that people had social expectations from interactive robots. If robots are to become a part of our everyday lives, it isn't enough if they help us physically. They need to provide
            <em>mental and emotional assistance</em> as well. This thought helped us derive our research question...</p>

          <p>We had done the groundwork, were super inspired, and had our research question and hypotheses - but we needed a way to test them. We built
            <em>SIM</em> - our prototype of a socially intelligent robot. SIM can engage in
            <em>affective interchanges</em> with people by
            <em>understanding</em> and
            <em>expressing</em> emotions. It's behavior is governed by what we call the Social Interaction Model.</p>
          <p>Built on theories of human emotion from psychology, behavioral sciences and human-robot interaction, the SIM table is essentially a
            <em>map</em> of situations, emotions, behaviors, and functions. The SIM table defines how SIM would
            <em>react to an emotional stimulus</em> in a given situation, and how that emotional response would
            <em>affect the dynamics</em> of that interaction.</p>

          <p>Knowing what emotions SIM needed to express before-hand made it much easier to work out the design and technical details.</p>
          <p>For the body, we used three motors - two for the head and one for the torso. This gave us enough
            <em>flexibility</em> to design expressive movements. We mounted an android powered phone for SIM's head, giving us
            <em>a blank canvas</em> to design the face on.</p>
          <p>For the facial design, we wanted to keep things as simple as possible. I designed SIM's face to be
            <em>minimal, but super versatile</em>, so SIM's expressions are
            <em>exaggerated</em> and easily understandable.</p>
          <p>After a few rounds of iteration, we had a prototype that we could put in front of people to test our hypotheses.</p>

          <p>It was time to put SIM to the ultimate test! We designed a study based around
            <em>building trust</em> with the robot, and tested
            <em>two different versions</em> of SIM with each user - one with social intelligence and one without. Our goal was to see if people trusted the socially intelligent model more than the other model.</p>
          <p>The study had users team up with SIM to
            <em>make decisions</em> on fairly ambiguous questions, like picking the dominant color in a picture. We repeated this task multiple times, and had SIM agree or disagree with the user on each round. We observed the interactions for trends in the
            number of times the users would change their answers based on SIM's suggestions, and how this changed over time and between versions.</p>

          <p>We found that people
            <em>personified</em> the socially intelligent robot, using adjectives like fun, cute, friendly, happy, helpful and thoughtful to describe it. We also found that people
            <em>trusted</em> the socially intelligent version a little more, and tried to
            <em>engage in conversation</em> and ask it for reasons behind its suggestions.</p>
          <p>The study showed that social intelligence in robots is definitely a step in the right direction. With this prototype and study, we only tested
            <em>trust</em>. This is only the first step towards building intuitive and natural interactions between humans and robots. Given more time and resources, our goal is to
            <em>bump up SIM's fidelity</em>, designing a shell and improving the facial expressions. One of the major challenges that we faced as a team exploring this space was that there are
            <em>no targeted tools</em> for designing and prototyping robotics. We hope to
            <em>create a platform</em> that will encourage people to explore the social robotics space.</p>
